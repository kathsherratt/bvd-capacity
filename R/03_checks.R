#' Refuse to let a broken build pass for a finished one.
#'
#' Every check here is about internal consistency, not about whether the model
#' read the report well. That question is settled upstream, by the quote gate
#' in R/02_resolve.R, and cannot be reopened here. What this script asks is
#' narrower and answerable: does every event name a facility the registry
#' knows, does every facility's summary follow from its own events, is every
#' date one the corpus could have produced.
#'
#' The facilities table is recomputed from the events table by a second,
#' independent implementation and compared column by column. Two
#' implementations agreeing is weak evidence and one disagreeing is strong
#' evidence, which is the useful direction: a silent change to the derivation
#' shows up as a mismatch rather than as a number nobody checks.
#'
#' Exit 1 on any failure, 0 otherwise. Counts print either way.
#'
#' Usage:
#'     Rscript R/03_checks.R

#' A reject is a quote that is not a span of the report, or one that does not
#' name what it evidences. Either way the event is out of the data. The first
#' fix is to reread that report: over the corpus that cleared 13 of 14.
#'
#' What remains is a paraphrase the model repeats. Acknowledging one in
#' `checks/rejected_acknowledged.csv` says a person read it against the report
#' and expects no rerun to fix it. It admits nothing: the event stays out of
#' the data exactly as before, and only the build's exit code changes, so that
#' a fresh reject is visible against a clean run rather than lost in a count
#' that was never zero.
