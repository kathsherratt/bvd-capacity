#' Where everything lives.
#'
#' This repository reads the INSP situation reports only through the corpus
#' that bvd-sitreps publishes, and finds it by path. Nothing here opens a PDF,
#' and nothing sources code from bvd-sitreps: a change there reaches this
#' repository as changed files in the corpus, which the cache keys below see,
#' never as changed behaviour. If a question cannot be answered from
#' `data/corpus/`, the fix belongs in bvd-sitreps.
#'
#' `BVD_SITREPS` points at a bvd-sitreps checkout; the default is a sibling
#' clone.

#' What the pipeline could not settle by itself. Small, committed, and read by
