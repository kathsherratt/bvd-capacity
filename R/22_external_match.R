#'
#' Check the external readings, then say what they corroborate.
#'
#' Two steps, in the order the corpus pipeline uses them.
#'
#' First the quote gate, unchanged: an event survives only if its quote is a
#' span of the document the model was shown and names the facility it claims
#' to evidence. A publisher's document earns no exemption from this.
#'
#' Then matching, which is deliberately weaker than the register's own
#' resolution. A WHO sentence saying "the Ebola treatment centre in Bunia" is
#' not the INSP name `CTE de Bunia`, and pretending the two are one string
#' would manufacture agreement. So a match is made on place and kind, through
#' the same folding the register uses, and every row says how it was made:
#'
#'   `id`          the external name folds to a register facility_id
#'   `place_kind`  same place key and same site_kind as exactly one facility
#'   `place_only`  the place is in the register but the kind is not there
#'   `unmatched`   the external document names a facility the register lacks
#'
#' `unmatched` is the interesting column. It is either a facility the reports
#' never named, or a name for one they named differently, and both are worth
#' a person's eye. Nothing here writes into the register.
#'
#' Usage:
#'     Rscript R/22_external_match.R [--source=who_don]
