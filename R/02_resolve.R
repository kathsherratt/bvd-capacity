#'
#' Verify every quote, resolve names to facilities, derive the two datasets.
#'
#' The gate comes first and is not negotiable: a quote must still be a span of
#' the report as `render_report()` renders it today, and must still contain the
#' facility as the model wrote it. A failure is a rendering bug, a gap in
#' `normalise_for_match()` or a model that did not copy, and all three are
#' reasons to drop the event rather than to reason around it. Rejections go to
#' outputs/rejected_events.csv with a reason, and R/03_checks.R fails while any
#' remain. Do not add an exemption file here.
#'
#' Two keys, not one. `name_key` identifies a facility, so `HGR Bunia` and
#' `CTE de l'HGR Bunia` stay apart. `place_key` identifies the locality both
#' sit at, and is what later passes over this corpus (laboratories,
#' vaccination, burials) can key on without building a second name vocabulary.
#'
#' Judgement is flagged, never applied. Rows in the registry marked
#' `reviewed = TRUE` are human decisions and win; everything else is a guess
#' this script made and may remake.
#'
#' Usage:
#'     Rscript R/02_resolve.R [--cache=DIR] [--out=DIR]
